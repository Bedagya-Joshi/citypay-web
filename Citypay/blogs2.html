                    How To Receive Remittance Digitally from Abroad Using
                    City pay Wallet
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Remittances serve as a vital lifeline for many
                    households in Nepal, providing essential financial
                    support and significantly influencing the country's
                    economy. A recent study using a Keynesian framework
                    found that remittances positively impact Nepal’s
                    economic resilience. Over the years, the inflow of
                    remittances has increased significantly, leading to
                    growth in key macroeconomic variables such as Gross
                    National Product (GNP), private consumption, government
                    expenditure, and imports. For every one-unit increase in
                    remittances, there is a corresponding increase in
                    consumption (0.89 units), imports (1.25 units),
                    investment (0.32 units), and GNP (2.14 units). These
                    inflows contribute to overall economic stability and
                    development. In the fiscal year 2022/23, an astonishing
                    771,000 young individuals embarked on foreign employment
                    from Nepal, according to the Department of Foreign
                    Employment (DoFE). This figure includes both new and
                    re-permit workers who acquired work permits during the
                    fiscal year 2022/2023. During Shrawan 2023 (mid-July to
                    mid-August), Nepali migrant workers sent a historic high
                    of Rs. 116.2 billion in remittances. In the fiscal year
                    2021/22, remittance inflows increased to Rs. 1,007.31
                    billion, accounting for 20.8% of Nepal’s GDP.

                    The Evolution of Remittance Method: From Traditional to
                    Digital
                </h3>

                <p>
                    In the past, migrant workers faced significant
                    challenges when sending money to their families in
                    Nepal. Traditional methods, such as bank transfers and
                    wire transfers, were not only slow and costly but also
                    required extensive paperwork. However, technological
                    advancements have revolutionized the remittance process.
                    Digital platforms, mobile apps, and blockchain
                    technology now offer faster, more secure options.
                    Furthermore, artificial intelligence enhances security
                    and personalization. As a result, digital remittance is
                    gradually replacing outdated approaches, providing a
                    convenient and efficient solution for international
                    money transfers.
